**Summary:** This paper contains a comprehensive review and foward-looking perspective on the integration of mobile communication and AI from 5G and beyond 5G (B5G). 

## Sections Summary

- `1. Mobile Communication and AI`
  - Mobile communication has gone through a significant evolution from analog to digital, from voice-only to voice and data, and from circuit switching to IP-based systems.
  - When 4G was established, the industry started to emphasize automation and intelligence to handle increasingly complex communication networks and personalized services.
  - We are now generating vast amounts of data which facilitates the application of AI in the communication field.
  
- `2. Development Roadmap of Mobile Communication and AI`
  - Mobile industry evolved through 3GPP standards from 2G to 5G, with AI concepts introduced around 2008 via self-organizing networks (SON).
  - Telecom AI evolution: Initially limited, AI in telecom grew rapidly post-2017 with 3GPP research on 5G features, network optimization, and data analytics.
  - Organizations like 3GPP, ETSI, O-RAN, and ITU developed AI frameworks and standardization for mobile networks and federated learning integration into 5G.
