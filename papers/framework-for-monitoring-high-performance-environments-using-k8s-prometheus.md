**Author(s):** Nitin Sukhija; Elizabeth Bautista

**Paper URL:** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9060302

**Summary:** The Operations Monitoring and Notification Infrastructure (OMNI) framework is proposed to proactively manage and monitor data center operations using technologies like Kubernetes, Prometheus and Grafana. 

**Pages:** 6

## Sections Summary

- `1. Introduction`
  - Monitoring computational centers becomes increasingly challenging as they grow, leading to alert fatigue where true issues are obscured by numerous false alarms.
  - An HPC (High-Performance Computing) environment is a computing system designed to perform complex calculations and process large amounts of data at high speeds, typically using supercomputers or clusters of powerful servers working in parallel. Extreme-scale HPC environments require sophisticated automation and orchestration to manage diverse components like compute cores, memory, interconnects, power, and cooling systems.
  - Traditional alert methods become less effective due to the high volume of alerts. Advanced monitoring tools are needed for comprehensive oversight, proactive monitoring, scalability planning, trend analysis, and efficient operation.
  - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's NERSC developed OMNI, integrating Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana, to manage data, visualize performance, and enhance operational efficiency, providing real-time and predictive analytics through a unified view of performance metrics and historical trends.
