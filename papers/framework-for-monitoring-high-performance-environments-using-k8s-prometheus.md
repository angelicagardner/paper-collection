## Sections Summary

- `1. Introduction`
  - An HPC (High-Performance Computing) environment is a computing system designed to perform complex calculations and process large amounts of data at high speeds. Extreme-scale HPC environments require sophisticated automation and orchestration to manage diverse components like compute cores, memory, interconnects, power, and cooling systems.
  - Monitoring computational centers becomes increasingly challenging as they grow, leading to alert fatigue where true issues are obscured by numerous false alarms.
  - Traditional alert methods become less effective due to the high volume of alerts.
  - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's NERSC developed OMNI, integrating Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana, to provide real-time and predictive analytics through a unified view of performance metrics and historical trends.
    
- `2. Background and Related Work`
  - An efficient monitoring solution takes into consideration scalability and HA, automation, dashboards, actionable insight analytics and capacity planning, distribution and customization.
  - Previous project examples include Trinity Monitoring infrastructure and OpenLorenz. The proposed monitoring framework in this framework integrates with modern platforms (Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana) to provide a unified solution and aims to provide dynamic and real-time, and is specifically designed to handle the monitoring and management needs of extreme-scale systems.
