**Summary:** This research paper explores the use of Anycast as a feature for load balancing in distributed systems. Anycast enables the delivery of user requests to the nearest or best-performing service instance by leveraging routing protocols. This approach automatically redirects traffic during server or location failures. The paper highlights its advantages over traditional DNS-based load balancing, including faster failover and seamless recovery, making it an efficient solution for modern, globally distributed networks.

## Sections Summary

### `Introduction`
- The traditional load balancing (LB) setup is to deploy multiple service replicas and use LB to distribute user requests across the replicas.
- The traditional setup can't handle backend service failures.
- Advanced/enhanced LB design redirects user requests to the nearest secondary location if the primary backend fails.
- If both LBs fail, users cannot access alternate service instances. To ensure uninterrupted user access is critical.
- DNS records can be updated to direct users to an alternate service location but DNS-based solutions, while possible, are suboptimal due to delays and complexity. The DNS TTL (Time-to-Live) propagation delays can result in user downtime, and additional steps are required to revert DNS records once the original service is restored.
- A more seamless and efficient approach involves leveraging enhanced LB capabilities with integrated monitoring and failover mechanisms.
