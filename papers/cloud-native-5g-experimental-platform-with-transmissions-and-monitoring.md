**Pages:** 6

**Summary:** This article introduces a framework that enhances LCM of 5G networks through CN deployments and E2E monitoring. The framework demonstrates containerized network functions, like Open5GS, in a Kubernetes cluster with multi-access edge computing (MEC). It also implements a Prometheus-based monitoring system visualized via Grafana dashboards, showcasing use cases in user plane function re-selection and user mobility management.
