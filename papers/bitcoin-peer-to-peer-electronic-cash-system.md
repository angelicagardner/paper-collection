# Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

**Author(s):** Satoshi Nakamoto

**Paper URL:** https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

**Pages:** 8

**Summary:** This paper proposes a decentralized digital currency that allows people to send payments directly to each other without relying on banks. It introduces a public ledger called the blockchain and uses a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work to prevent double-spending and ensure transaction security. The suggested system removes the need for trusted third parties and creates a limited-supply, peer-to-peer electronic cash network.

## Sections Summary

### `1. Introduction`

- Current internet commerce relies on "trusted" financial institutions that act as intermediaries

- This paper argues we need a system based on cryptographic proof so two parties can transact directly without a middleman.

- To prevent "double-spending" without a central authority, the paper proposes a distributed peer-to-peer server that generates a public, chronological record of transactions secured by the network's collective CPU power.
  
### `2. Transactions`

- An electronic coin is defined as a chain of digital signatures where owners transfer value by signing a hash of the previous transaction, though this technical verification alone cannot prove that an owner hasn't already spent the coin elsewhere.

- Relying on a central authority (a "mint") to prevent double-spending creates a single point of failure where the fate of the entire system depends on the company running it.

- To eliminate the central authority, all transactions must be publicly announced so that the entire network can agree on a single, chronological history of transactions based on which one the majority of nodes received first.
