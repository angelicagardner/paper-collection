# Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

**Author(s):** Satoshi Nakamoto

**Paper URL:** https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

**Pages:** 8

**Summary:** This paper proposes a decentralized digital currency that allows people to send payments directly to each other without relying on banks. It introduces a public ledger called the blockchain and uses a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work to prevent double-spending and ensure transaction security. The suggested system removes the need for trusted third parties and creates a limited-supply, peer-to-peer electronic cash network.
